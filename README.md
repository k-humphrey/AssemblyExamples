# AssemblyExamples
hello! This is another retro repo where I upload my previous classwork in Assembly. I'm starting with x86 Assembly class, it was an exciting class that made me want to look into computer architecture! If I remember correctly I made a 100 on all programs
but I need to check over this when I have time to. So, look forward to that.
